## Homemade C++ STL Container
There are a couple of non-standard implementations in form of cyclic version of STL container. I built this with template -- to ensure type generalization, constructor, copy constructor, copy assignment, move semantics, operator overloading, and virtual destructor to prevent memory leak.

Here are C++ STL Containers which I tried to built myself from scratch:

 - cforward_list.h: cyclic single linked-list
 - clist.h: cylic double linked-list
 - dLink.h: based object for implementing any type of lists.
 - forward_list.h: standard single linked-list
 - list.h: standard double linked-list
 - stack.h: standard stack
 - vector.h: standard array type
